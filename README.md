#Countdown
Countdown is my first angular app and thus basically my little playground with a lot of errors. However the app itself works pretty well. It allows you to create countdowns that a stored in the browser's LocalStorage.

Please note that I just wanted to get this this to work for now. The code is pretty ugly right now.

##Usage
Open `index.html` in your browser (or run a local webserver to use it on your phone). Then create a new event by typing in the text-box (Example: "Test-Event tomorrow 16:00").
